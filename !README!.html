<h1>Regarding update from versions prior to 2.0</h1>

<p>Version 2.0 of BeDrive is esentially an entirely new application, this means <br>
updating from older versions is more difficult and has more possible risks.</p>

<p>If updating from version prior to 2.0, we highly recommend doing the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Backup BeDrive database.</li>
	<li>Move old BeDrive files to a different folder (don't delete them).</li>
	<li>Upload new files into an empty folder.</li>
</ol>

<p>Afterwards you can copy user uploaded files (if stored locally) and move <br>
.env file from old folder, see documentation for more details on this.</p>
